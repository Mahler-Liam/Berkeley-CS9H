The paper mainly focuses on the application of AI in the military area and space technology. The background information will be given first and the following research questions which have been conducted will be listed. Then the paper will show the answers of the interviewees in detail. After it, the paper will give the author's personal opinions on how to utilize AI in military and space technology combining the results of interview.At the end of paper a decise conclusion will be given to summarize the whole article.

In May, 2023, American media reported a shocking news that a drone which was controlled by AI killed its human operator$^{[2]}$. If the news was true, it would be the first event that AI killed people. Though it has been refuted by the U.S. Air Force later, we still can't believe whether it's true or not. Because we have reasons to believe that the U.S. Air Force take this action to avoid unnecessary panic，we human being as a whole should repair the house before it rains in all aspects. And this article is specialized for discussing whether we should support AI’s development in military, what can we do to specify and standardize AI’s development in military and how can AI support human’s technology’s development especially in space exploration.

Combining the answers from questionnaire and interview, I find that in general people aren’t afraid about that AI will threaten the survival of human beings because they think with powerful rules and regulations AI can be developed in a normal way. Also, people don’t care about the event like “AI killed its human controller” which is obvious in the questionnaire. They just keep an indifferent attitude. However, when it comes to specific fields like military, the majority of respondents hold an opposing attitude towards the AI’s application in it. They all think AI should be supervised strictly. Most of their reasons is that AI will exacerbate the intensity of war and make the world more unstable. From the two sides of respondents’ reaction, I think the common people’s awareness about AI security is still very weak because it seems to far that AI will cause unsafety and threaten their survival to their individual.
 Accordingly, it’s of necessity to strengthen the supervision of AI. And AI’s application in war is of the priority, which may be put human to the edge of extinction. From my personal view also combining respondents' perspectives, I think supervise AI’s application in military can be conducted from the following aspects. .First, International cooperation and negotiations: Countries should actively formulate common standards and legal frameworks to regulate the application of artificial intelligence in military. This can be achieved through international organizations, diplomatic channels, and multilateral negotiations, prompting countries to reach consensus. Second, Establish international legal guidelines: The international community can formulate international legal standards, and clearly stipulates the limitation and obligations of artificial intelligence in military use.These standards may include ensuring the ultimate responsibility and control of human decision makers, compliance with international humanitarian law, preventing unauthorized use, respect for privacy and data protection. Third, Ethics review and audit mechanism: Establish an independent ethical review and audit mechanism, and evaluate and supervise artificial intelligence military projects.These mechanisms may include expert organizations, independent committees or regulators, and are responsible for evaluating the compliance, morality and security of the project. Fourth, Transparency and accountability system: Ensure that the use of artificial intelligence systems in the military field has transparency and accountability system. This includes public disclosure of the functions, algorithms and data sources of the artificial intelligence system, as well as the establishment mechanism to investigate and investigate and pursue the improper behavior or damage that the artificial intelligence system may produce in the war.  
	Despite people’s cautious attitude towards AI’s application in war and military, people believe AI can help people avoid mistakes in the high-precision fields. They are shocked by the AI’s power and they keep an optimistic view towards AI’s development. As the Godfather of AI says ,”We are now at a transition point, and the next AI will be everywhere”[2], we can’t stop AI’s develop and what we should now is to manage to utilize AI correctly and rationally. I think if we mankind can effectively integrate AI to high precision and high-tech fields, the civilization of human will come to a new stage. Maybe interstellar colonization with the help of AI will come true as the Asimov wrote in Galaxy Empire[3]. What we now should do is to explore a way of reasonably utilizing AI. In the foreseeable future, I think it can be realized from these ways.
